Description: The SplicingFactory R package uses transcript-level expression
    values to analyze splicing diversity based on various statistical measures,
    like Shannon entropy or the Gini index. These measures can quantify
    transcript isoform diversity within samples or between conditions.
    Additionally, the package analyzes the isoform diversity data, looking for
    significant changes between conditions.
